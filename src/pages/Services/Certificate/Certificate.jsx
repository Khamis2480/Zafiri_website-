        <p>
          An <strong>Ethical Certificate</strong> is an official document issued by ZAFIRI 
          to ensure that research is conducted responsibly, safely, and in line with 
          recognized ethical standards. It confirms that the research proposal has been 
          reviewed for participant protection, environmental sustainability, and scientific 
          integrity.
