        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Our <strong>Fish Catch and Stock Assessment</strong> research focuses on
          evaluating fish populations, monitoring catch data, and analyzing
          stock health. This work helps ensure sustainable fishing practices
          while supporting Zanzibar‚Äôs fisheries management and long-term food
          security.

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Fish is the backbone of Zanzibar‚Äôs diet and economy. Reliable stock
          assessments guide sustainable fishing regulations, prevent overfishing,
          and protect the livelihoods of local communities while conserving
          marine ecosystems for future generations.
