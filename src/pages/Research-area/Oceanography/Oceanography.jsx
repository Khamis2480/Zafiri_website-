        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>Oceanography Research</strong> program at ZAFIRI explores
          the physical, chemical, and biological processes of the ocean and
          their influence on marine life and human activities. This research
          helps predict changes in the marine environment and supports
          sustainable resource management.

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Oceanography provides critical insights into the health of marine
          ecosystems and their role in regulating climate. For Zanzibar,
          understanding ocean dynamics is key to sustaining fisheries,
          protecting coastlines, and supporting the blue economy.
