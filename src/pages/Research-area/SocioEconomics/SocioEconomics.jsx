        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The socio-economic dimension of fisheries and aquaculture focuses on 
          the well-being of fishing communities, market dynamics, livelihoods, 
          and policies that influence sustainable development. At ZAFIRI, 
          we assess how fisheries contribute to food security, poverty 
          reduction, and the blue economy in Zanzibar and beyond.

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding socio-economics helps ensure fisheries and aquaculture 
          are not only ecologically sustainable but also socially equitable. 
          This area is key to improving income, reducing poverty, and empowering 
          coastal communities in Zanzibar while strengthening national food security.
