        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>Fish Disease Research</strong> program at ZAFIRI focuses on
          understanding fish pathogens, improving disease diagnostics, and
          developing sustainable management strategies to ensure the health of
          both wild and farmed fish populations.

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Fish health is vital for food security, aquaculture productivity, and
          ecosystem balance. Research on fish diseases protects livelihoods,
          ensures sustainable fisheries, and prevents economic losses for
          communities depending on aquatic resources.
