        <p>
          The <strong>Fish Breeding and Feeding</strong> research area focuses on improving fish growth,
          survival, and productivity through selective breeding, nutrition optimization, and feed
          formulation. At ZAFIRI, our goal is to enhance aquaculture sustainability, reduce production
          costs, and support food security through scientifically guided breeding and feeding practices.

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Fish breeding and feeding are key pillars of <strong>sustainable aquaculture</strong>. 
          By enhancing growth efficiency and feed conversion, we help local farmers increase 
          productivity while protecting marine environments. This contributes to Zanzibar‚Äôs 
          <strong>Blue Economy</strong> and supports long-term food and livelihood security.
