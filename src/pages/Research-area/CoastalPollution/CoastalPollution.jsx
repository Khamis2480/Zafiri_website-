        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>Coastal and Marine Pollution Research</strong> program 
          focuses on identifying, monitoring, and mitigating pollutants that 
          threaten Zanzibar‚Äôs marine and coastal ecosystems. From plastic waste 
          to chemical contaminants, our research addresses critical challenges 
          affecting marine biodiversity and coastal livelihoods.
