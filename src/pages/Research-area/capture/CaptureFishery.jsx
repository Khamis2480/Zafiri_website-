        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>Capture Fishery</strong> research area focuses on wild fish
          harvesting techniques, monitoring fishing practices, and assessing
          their ecological and socio-economic impacts. Our work aims to balance
          fishing livelihoods with the long-term sustainability of Zanzibar‚Äôs
          marine ecosystems.

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Capture fisheries provide food, jobs, and cultural heritage for
          Zanzibar‚Äôs coastal communities. Sustainable management ensures that
          fish stocks remain healthy, marine biodiversity is preserved, and
          future generations continue benefiting from marine resources.
