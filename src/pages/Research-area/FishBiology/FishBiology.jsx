        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Fish Biology</strong> research at ZAFIRI focuses on the
          physiology, genetics, reproduction, and behavior of fish species. This
          knowledge supports conservation, aquaculture, and sustainable fisheries
          management in Zanzibar and beyond.

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding fish biology is crucial for managing fisheries resources,
          protecting biodiversity, and supporting aquaculture innovations. It
          helps Zanzibar preserve marine ecosystems while strengthening food
          security and livelihoods.
